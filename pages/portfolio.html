                    <h4>Cocoalicious Treats by Bri:</h4>
                    <p>When Bri Beckler started Cocoalicious Treats by Bri, 
                        her goal was to provide high quality chocolate treats 
                        for individuals and businesses. What started out as an 
                        evolving passion throughout the pandemic, quickly turned
                         into a successful small business. Bri had limited marketing
                          her business to Instagram and a Facebook page. Customers
                           would often ask if she had an actual website that they 
                           could go to. That’s where we came in, LITE Web Services
                            developed a custom 4 page website that highlighted why
                             Cocoalicious Treats by Bri is the best treats business
                              in town. Her website now establishes her business and
                               products with more credibility and provides the crucial
                                digital representation she was previously lacking. </p>

                    <h4>The problem</h4>
                    <p>Bombay Market had been around since 2017, but was not well represented on the internet.
                        The former Bombay Market website was created by the previous owner of the shop and it 
                        contained lots of outdated information, and the new owners had no way to take this website
                        down as they lacked access to it. 
                    </p><br>
                    <h4>Our solution</h4>
                    <p>After meeting with the new owners of the shop, we wanted to give Bombay Market a stronger
                        online presence. We did this by taking the old website off of the internet and creating a brand
                        new website to highlight their goods and present information that they want their customers to know.

                    <h4>Their story</h4>
                        <p>Champaign Central FBLA’s chapter has been growing since it was established in 2016. 
                            The only problem with the chapter was that it did not have a useful place to showcase 
                            information, links, and community involvement displayed in one place. Because both of us are 
                            active members and officers of this chapter, we offered to develop a website that would 
                            market, promote, and inform our community and members about FBLA events. The chapter agreed 
                            to use our services and we developed this website that has proven to be useful as we included 
                            quick access links and information.
